# video_action_recognition Using TSN

Download the video action recognition using MMAction2.ipynb file and just run it. reasons for implementing this method will be mentioned below.

The advancements in computer vision especially in image classification domain can't be used in video action recognition task because 2DCNN's can't understanding the time component or temporal dimension in the videos.
To solve this problem we have two choices 1) using 3D CNN's to model the temporal dimension 2) using optical flow component to trian the model.
Using the 3D CNN is computationally expensive than the 2D CNN's. Using optical flow component needs lot of memory to store the optical flow frames.
